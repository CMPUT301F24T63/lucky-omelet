CMPUT 301 Fall Project

[Project Problem Description](https://ualberta-cmput301.github.io/projects/project_problem_descr.html)

We are aiming to make an event-lottery app. It allows users to create an event, joining the waiting list of an event, and apply a lottery system to decide which users can sign up for the event.
